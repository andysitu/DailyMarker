# DailyMarker

Using ASP.NET and C#, JavaScript, & HTML to create a daily task tracking website. I had previously started writing this in Python using Djano.

Keeps track of the tasks you've done and tasks you hope to make a habit of doing.

I use Visual Studio to load the project.

## Ideas:
* Use Storage to record Month/Year so reloading the page will nagivate to that date
* As a result, add a way to nagivate to the current month/year
* New Tasks Types
  * Tasks counting # of things completed task
* Allow user ability to manually set a month&year
* Ability to set order of the tasks
* Ability to change colors of the selected dates
* Data Visualization
